Welcome to my blog!

I'm a student at the University of Toronto studying [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/#:~:text=Engineering%20science%20is%20an%20interdisciplinary,scientific%2C%20engineering%20and%20arts%20principles.) with a focus in Machine Learning and Robotics. Iâ€™m interested in a wide range of topics, including ML for climate, [[Robotics|robot learning and simulations]], geography, and transportation.

I'm currently a research intern at UofT, collaborating with Nvidia on building better robotics simulators.
