Welcome to my website!

I'm a student at the University of Toronto studying [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/#:~:text=Engineering%20science%20is%20an%20interdisciplinary,scientific%2C%20engineering%20and%20arts%20principles.) with a focus in Machine Learning and Robotics. Iâ€™m interested in a wide range of topics, including ML for climate, robot learning and simulations, geography, and transportation.
