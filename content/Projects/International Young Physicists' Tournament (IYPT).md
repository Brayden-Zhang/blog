<h2>About the <a href="https://iypt.org">International Young Physicists Tournament</a></h2>

<p>

    The <a href="https://iypt.org">International Young Physicists Tournament</a> is a science competition in which teams of high school students compete to solve research problems based on physical phenomena. Teams have several months to prepare their solutions and eventually present to a panel of judges, who evaluate the presentations based on their originality and scientific rigor.

    <br>The following are two of the problems that I worked on in 2021 and 2022, where I finished top ten in Canada and was a finalist for the national team, spending 300+ hours investigating these phenomena and coming up with a report and defense for my findings.

<h3>Unsinkable Disk</h3>

<p>

    <i>"A metal disk with a hole at its centre sinks in a container filled with water. When a vertical water jet hits the centre of the disc, it may float on the water surface. Explain this phenomenon and investigate the relevant parameters."</i>

<h3>Bead Dynamics</h3>

<p><i>A circular hoop rotates about a vertical diameter. A small bead is allowed to roll in a groove on the inside of the hoop. Investigate the relevant parameters affecting the dynamics of the bead.</i></p>
