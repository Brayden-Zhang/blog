Work submitted for the Citadel Invitational Datathon 2024.

Data Science competition held by Citadel. I was selected as one of 150 students from over 3000 applicants to participate in the competition. The competition was held over a 5 day period, where we were given a few datasets and a prompt, and tasked with coming up with models that would help solve a problem of your choosing. My team chose to investigate the impact of food deserts on obesity in the United States. We used a variety of machine learning models to predict obesity rates in different counties in the United States, and then used these predictions to investigate the relationship between food deserts and obesity rates.
