Built a sumo robot completely from scratch, using a combination of 3D printing and soldering. The robot was designed to compete in a sumo robot competition, where the goal is to push the opponent out of the ring. The robot was controlled using an Arduino, and was programmed to use a combination of sensors to detect the opponent and push them out of the ring.

We gained skills in:

- 3D Design & printing
- Soldering
- Arduino programming
- Sensor integration
